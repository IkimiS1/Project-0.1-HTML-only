      <section>
        <h2>The Story Behind BrewBuddyâ„¢</h2>
        <p>
          BrewBuddyâ„¢ was born out of a simple frustration â€” the gap between cafÃ©
          coffee and home coffee. Founder Ethan Caldwell, a former cafÃ© owner
          and awardâ€‘winning barista, knew that most home machines could never
          match the quality and consistency of a professional setup. In 2021,
          Ethan founded Luxe Inc. to change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          After four years of research, testing, and perfecting AIâ€‘powered
          brewing technology, BrewBuddyâ„¢ launched in 2025 â€” delivering
          cafÃ©â€‘level coffee, made your way, right in your kitchen.
