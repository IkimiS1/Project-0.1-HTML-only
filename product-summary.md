<h2>About Luxe Inc.</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Luxe Inc.</strong> is a lifestyle technology company specializing in
    <strong>premium smart home appliances</strong> that combine innovation, sustainability,
    and modern design.
</p>
<p>
    The company was founded in 2021 by <strong>Ethan Caldwell</strong>, a former café owner
    and award‑winning barista who experienced firsthand the gap between café‑quality coffee
    and the inconsistent results of most home brewing machines.
</p>

<h2>The Inspiration / Story Behind BrewBuddy™</h2>
<p>
    The vision for BrewBuddy™ was born out of Ethan’s own frustration.
</p>

<blockquote>
    “For years, I served perfect cappuccinos in my café, but when I tried making coffee at home,
    every machine gave me something different — too weak, too bitter, or just flat.
    I wanted a coffee maker that knew me.”<br>
    — <strong>Ethan Caldwell</strong>, Founder of Luxe Inc.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Determined to change the home coffee experience, Ethan founded Luxe Inc. and began developing
    BrewBuddy™ in 2021.
</p>
<p>
    For four years, Ethan and his team of engineers, designers, and coffee experts tested prototypes,
    perfected brewing algorithms, and gathered feedback from real coffee drinkers.
</p>
<p>
    In 2025, <strong>BrewBuddy™ finally launched</strong> — delivering café‑level coffee without the café trip.
