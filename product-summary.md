About Luxe Inc.
Luxe Inc. is a lifestyle technology company specializing in premium smart home appliances that combine innovation, sustainability, and modern design.

The company was founded in 2021 by Ethan Caldwell, a former café owner and award‑winning barista who experienced firsthand the gap between café‑quality coffee and the inconsistent results of most home brewing machines.

The Inspiration / Story Behind BrewBuddy™
The vision for BrewBuddy™ was born out of Ethan’s own frustration.

Ethan recalls:

“For years, I served perfect cappuccinos in my café, but when I tried making coffee at home, every machine gave me something different — too weak, too bitter, or just flat. I wanted a coffee maker that knew me.”

Determined to change the home coffee experience, Ethan founded Luxe Inc. and began developing BrewBuddy™ in 2021.
For four years, Ethan and his team of engineers, designers, and coffee experts tested prototypes, perfected brewing algorithms, and gathered feedback from real coffee drinkers.

In 2025, BrewBuddy™ finally launched — delivering café‑level coffee without the café trip.
